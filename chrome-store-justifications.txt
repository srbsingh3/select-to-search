CHROME WEB STORE LISTING - PERMISSIONS & PRIVACY JUSTIFICATIONS
=============================================================

PERMISSIONS WARNING - <all_urls>
------------------------------
Yes, this permission is needed.

Storage Justification:
The <all_urls> permission is essential for this extension's core functionality:

1. Text Detection: The extension needs to run a content script on every webpage to detect when users select text. Without this permission, the extension would only work on a limited set of websites.

2. Universal Functionality: Users expect to be able to select text anywhere on the internet and quickly search it in their preferred AI provider (ChatGPT, Google Search, or Claude).

3. Non-Intrusive Operation: The content script only:
   - Listens for text selection events
   - Displays a lightweight floating UI when text is selected
   - Communicates with the background service to open new tabs
   - Does not modify, collect, or transmit any page content except the user's selected text

4. User Control: The extension operates entirely on user-initiated actions (text selection) and can be easily disabled/removed by the user at any time.

This permission is strictly required for the extension to perform its stated function of enabling quick searches from any webpage.

SCRIPTING PERMISSION JUSTIFICATION
----------------------------------
The scripting permission is required to inject the content script into webpages dynamically. This allows the extension to:

1. Inject the selection detection script into all webpages that users visit
2. Manage script injection at runtime without requiring tab reloads after installation
3. Comply with Manifest V3 requirements (replaces deprecated tabs.executeScript API)
4. Dynamically inject scripts only when needed for better performance

This permission is used solely for injecting the lightweight content script that detects text selection and displays the floating action button. No other scripts are injected or executed.

PERMISSIONS REMOVED
--------------------
The following permissions have been removed from the extension:

1. TABS PERMISSION - REMOVED
   Previously used for opening new tabs with chrome.tabs.create(). Now using window.open() which doesn't require special permissions.

2. ACTIVE TAB PERMISSION - REMOVED
   Not needed since <all_urls> host permission already provides necessary access for content scripts to run on all pages.

REQUIRED FIELDS:

1. PURPOSE: How do you collect or use data?
We use chrome.storage.sync to save user preferences (enabled/disabled AI providers, extension settings). The only data transmitted is the user's selected text, which is sent to the user-chosen AI provider's website via URL parameters. No data is sent to our servers.

2. PURPOSE: Is data shared with third parties?
The selected text is shared with the AI provider the user chooses (ChatGPT, Google Search, or Claude) by opening their website with the text as a URL parameter. This is a direct action initiated by the user. We do not collect, store, or share any user data with any other third parties.

3. PURPOSE: What data is collected?
User preferences stored locally in browser (provider settings, extension preferences). No browsing history, personal information, or usage analytics are collected. The only temporary data is the text selected by the user, which is sent to their chosen provider's website.

4. Single Purpose: How does this extension have a single purpose?
This extension has a single purpose: to allow users to quickly search selected text in their preferred AI provider (ChatGPT, Google Search, or Claude) by selecting text on any webpage and clicking a floating action button.

5. Intrusiveness: How is the extension minimally intrusive?
The extension requires <all_urls> permission to inject a content script that detects text selection on any webpage. It also requires tabs permission to open new tabs for the search providers and storage permission to save user preferences. The content script only activates when users select text and displays a minimal UI overlay. No page content is modified or collected except for the user's selected text.

6. Human Readable Summary:
Select-to-Search enables instant AI-powered searches from any webpage. Simply select text, and a floating button appears to search it in ChatGPT, Google, or Claude. No API keys required - it uses your existing sessions.
