# Linear Loading Page Style Notes
- **Palette**: Light mode uses `#f5f5f5` sidebar, `#fcfcfc` main surface, `#e0e0e0` borders, `#b0b5c0` secondary text, and `#23252a` highlights. Dark mode swaps to `#090909` sidebar, `#101012` main surface, `#23252a` borders, `#6b6f76` secondary text, and `#ffffff` highlights. Accent/selection color is `#7180ff`. Meta theme color is `#090909`.
- **Typography**: Primary font is `"Inter Variable"` with `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif` fallbacks. Font smoothing is enabled. Base overlay text uses `0.75rem` size (12px) and 500 weight with `1.5` line height; loading message text is 13px. Text rendering opts into `optimizeLegibility`.
- **Layout & Spacing**: HTML/body are 100% height with zero margins. Default sidebar width is `244px` (can shrink to 8px via user setting). Loading shell (`#loading`) is an absolute, full-screen flex container with 8px outer margins through `#appBorders` and a `1px` border. Main card (`#appBorders`) uses background `--bg-base-color`, 4px radius (token `--control-border-radius`, default 4px), and grows to fill space; margins collapse to -1px on narrow viewports ≤1023px. In Electron, top margin shifts to 40px.
- **Component Sizing**: Loading content area is 440px wide and 64px tall, centered with `margin-top: -32px` and `left: 50%` translate. Preloader icon region is 64×64. Loading text sits 8px below with slight negative margin to tuck upward; overall overlay uses `z-index: 99999`.
- **Behaviors**: Dark mode is chosen via `prefers-color-scheme: dark` or persisted config in `localStorage/sessionStorage`; the config can also override sidebar/base/border colors and sidebar width. A “logged-out” state forces sidebar width to -1px margins. Editable selection is prevented by `pointer-events: none` on the overlay. Selection highlight inside the overlay uses the accent blue.
- **Motion**: Fade-in on loading content (`0.4s ease-out` after 1s delay). Logo background pulse runs `3.2s` infinite after `1.2s`. Overlay opacity transitions over `0.1s` when the page marks itself as loaded; content and border transitions share a `0.45s` cubic-bezier timing.
- **Tokens**: `--scrollbar-width: 12px`; `--control-border-radius: 4px` default. Background, base, border, and text tokens swap between light/dark via the `html.dark` class.
